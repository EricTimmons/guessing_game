// game2.html is the finished game that just checks for a number match. Also below game two I've included my modified version of the game we played in class that identifies whether or not the answer you put in was even a number.


// game.html is a prototype game for guessing a certain card out of a deck of 52 cards. Still a WIP.

Pair work updates:
-added quit feature
